# MFE
MFE is a program for solving boundary value problems using the finite element method. 
 In this program, bicubic Lagrangian basis functions on triangular elements (10 local basis functions on each element) were used to approximate the solution. 
 
 The frontal method was used to construct the finite element mesh. Here it is possible to set the mesh only for a regular mesh, if you are familiar with frontal methods of mesh construction, you can easily upgrade this program to set an arbitrary mesh.
